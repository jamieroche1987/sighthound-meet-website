                    It's a very important part of your dogs life. Allowing your dog to be free and roam around with other dogs not only
                allows it to get the exercsise it requires but also mentally stimulates them.

                    Being around other sighthound owners will help new sighthound owners to understand all their quirky ways compared to
                    different breeds.

                <p>
                    Not only does your dog make new friends but also the owners make new connections. A lot of the owners arrange to look
                    after each others dogs.. which is pretty handy if your thinking of going away.

                    After having such an enthralling time on the walk you won't even realise the amount of exercise you've achieved
                    yourself.
