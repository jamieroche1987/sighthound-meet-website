## INITIAL IDEA CONCEPT

My initial idea for the project was to create an informative website about a sighthound monthly walk. My target audience is anyone who is the owner of a sighthound in Surrey and the surrounding areas. I wanted to make the website easy to navigate around while also making the images speak to the user.

* The Features I wanted the project to have are:

  * To make the site easy to read
  * Have an easy to navigate "Nav Bar"
  * Look appealing with images
  * Easy sign up form

#

## UX/UI

* The site should be simple to navigate
* The site should be easy to read, images should be clear without distorting or stretching
* The site should have information about the future sighthound meet up walks

Site Goals:

* To provide users with an easy read website with clear navigational links 
* To provide users with enough information to return to enter their participation in future walks.
* To make the site easily accessible

## USER STORIES

* As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site
* As a user, I want to be able to navigate the site with a nav bar thats easily seen and easy to read
* As a user, I want the site to inform me of future walks
* As a user, I want to see images related to the subject

## FEATURES

* The site consists of:
  * 3 main pages, HOME,GALLERY,SIGN UP! and an additional THANKYOU page
  * Each page will have the same body layout, HEADER (TITLE), NAVBAR, MAIN CONTENT (TEXT AND IMAGES) and FOOTER (SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS/LINKS, COPYRIGHT)
* Navigation bar:
  ![navbar](/assets/images/testing/navbar.png)
* Footer:
  ![footer](/assets/images/testing/footer.png)
* Layout and content:
  * The Home page will have a hero image with a text box on it which will inform the user that the walks are monthly
  ![homepage](/assets/images/testing/homepage1.png)
  * This part of the home page will have text telling the user what the benefits are for coming on the monthly walks.
  ![homepage](/assets/images/testing/homepage3.png)
  * This is a informative bar at the bottom of the page alerting the users to the times, dates and locations of the next 3 meet ups.
  ![homrpage](/assets/images/testing/homepage4.png)


  * The Gallery has multiple images from the previous sighthound walks that have taken place. It also consists of a video at the bottom of the page
 

  * The Sign up page will have a form to include first name, last name, email address and radio buttons to select the dates you wish to join the meet as well as a submit button. It will also contain a background image.
  
![signupform](/assets/images/testing/signup1.png)

  * The Thankyou page will have thank you text confirming they have submitted the form.

![thankyou](/assets/images/testing/thankyou1.png)

* Hover effect on the nav bar:
  * Indicates to the user the location of the mouse whilst navigating the menu
  * A underline helps the user to see which page they are going to select.
* Sign up form:
  * Form validation requests the user to input the correct information in the input fields,
      This avoids the user sending illegible text/email.
  * ![signupform](/assets/images/testing/signup1.png)

## DESIGN

* Color Scheme:
  * The color scheme used was a very simple one. Keeping the background as white helps to highlight the areas where i wish to draw the users attention to on each page.
  * I have a used a shade of blue with a different opacity depending on how visible i want the image to be behind the text boxes or form.
  ![headerblue](/assets/images/testing/headerblue.png) rgba(0, 170, 255, .5)
  ![Formblue](/assets/images/testing/formblue.png) rgba(0, 170, 255, .96)
  ![textcolor](/assets/images/testing/textcolor.png) #252525


* IMAGES
  * I sourced several images for the home page, gallery and sign up page.
  * There are a total of 16 images across the site, including one hero image and 2 background images.
  * All images have been compressed through [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/)
  * There is also a video that can be found on the Gallery page.


* TYPOGRAPHY
  * The fonts used for my website is "Eczar" and "Ubuntu". The font is imported from Google Fonts

## TESTING

* The site has been tested through multiple tests on each individual page.

* As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site:
  * Upon loading the home page, you will see the header stating what the webpage is about. You will also see that the hero image with a text box that indicates that this is a sighthound monthly walk page.
* As a user, I want to be able to navigate the site with an easy to see and read navbar:
  * This was fulfilled with clear to read wording, and an underline indicating which page you are about to select and view.
* As a user, I want the site to infrom me of future walks:
  * I have achieved this by setting an informative bar at the bottom of the home page with the locations, times and dates for the next 3 monthly walks.
* As a user, I want to see images related to the subject
  * I included a Gallery section which includes multiple varied images.
  * On the Home page, I included a hero image as well as one small image above the reasons to join the walk. There is also a background image behind the times section at the bottom of the page.
